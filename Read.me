# 🚦 Arduino Traffic Light with Pedestrian Crossing  

This project simulates a **traffic light system with pedestrian crossing control** using an Arduino.  
When a pedestrian presses a button, the car traffic light cycles through green → yellow → red, allowing pedestrians to safely cross.  

## ✨ Features  
- Realistic traffic light sequence (Green → Yellow → Red).  
- Pedestrian signals with push-button control.  
- Adjustable timing for delays and green phase.  
- Beginner-friendly introduction to Arduino I/O and timing.  

## 🛠 Hardware Requirements  
- 1 × Arduino board (Uno, Nano, Mega, etc.)  
- 3 × LEDs for cars (Red, Yellow, Green)  
- 2 × LEDs for pedestrians (Red, Green)  
- 1 × Push button (pedestrian request switch)  
- 5 × Resistors (220Ω for LEDs, 10kΩ for button if needed)  
- Jumper wires & breadboard  

## 📌 Pin Configuration  
| Component            | Arduino Pin |  
|----------------------|-------------|  
| Pedestrian Red LED   | 7           |  
| Pedestrian Green LED | 6           |  
| Car Red LED          | 5           |  
| Car Yellow LED       | 4           |  
| Car Green LED        | 3           |  
| Pedestrian Button    | 2           |  

## ⏱ Timing (adjustable)  
- Idle Time: **1000 ms** (1 second)  
- Green Phase: **4000 ms** (4 seconds)  

``` cpp
int idletime = 1000;   // 1 sec
int greenphase = 4000; // 4 sec
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Connect the components as per the pin configuration.

Upload the provided code to your Arduino.

Power the Arduino and observe the traffic light sequence.

Press the pedestrian button to activate the crossing cycle.

## 📂 Code

The main program is available in traffic_light.ino.

## 📖 Project Description

Arduino Traffic Light with Pedestrian Crossing simulates a real-world intersection using LEDs and a push-button. Cars follow green-yellow-red phases, while pedestrians get safe crossing time when the button is pressed. A beginner-friendly project to learn Arduino, timing, and digital I/O control.

Would you like me to also include a **schematic diagram image link placeholder** (like `![Circuit Diagram](diagram.png)`) so you can add it later when you have one?
